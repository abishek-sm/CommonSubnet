# Introduction
Gene networks are built using an algorithm that prints the result as gene pairs in descending order of importance. Once we had this list of gene pairs, I wrote some R code to analyze the gene pairs to find maximum common networks between cancers. 
# Results
We used 10 cancer data sets  and built networks using MMBOS. Using those results, we analyzed for maximal common subnetworks and show the result of one common subnetwork recovered for BIN1 gene which is implicated in Ovarian and Prostate cancer.
